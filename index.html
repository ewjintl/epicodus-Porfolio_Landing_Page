          <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
          <p> I was born and raised in Los Angeles, briefly lived in Tokyo for one year as an exchange student before
            coming home to gaduate with a BA from UCLA in 2015.
            Before coming to Epicodus I worked as a import/export analyst, and later as a litigation paralegal. Recently
            however, I've decided that I am looking for a career with
            more flexibilty, meaning and impact and thought that perhaps through programming I could realize this goal.
